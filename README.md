# Welcome to AyleeBot's documentation repository

**AyleeBot** is a **framework** used to build and launch private Discord bot instances, written by Cyc (cycloptux#1543) and based on the public [GiselleBot](https://docs.cycloptux.com/gisellebot/).

This repository will host the source documentation files, used to build the actual documentation websites hosted on the developer's website or ReadTheDocs.
