Premium Perks
*************

.. note::
    Most, or all, Premium features are enabled by default in AyleeBot-based Discord bots. This page is kept as a reference.

Throughout this documentation, you'll find a few notes about Premium-locked features. These features are only unlocked by either becoming a Patron for the developer, or by establishing a partnership with the developer.

Here's a link to our Patreon page: https://www.patreon.com/cycloptux

As a way to cover the hosting (and development) costs of the bot and its infrastructure, Patreon is used as the main source of month-to-month income.

.. seealso::
    `Patreon <https://www.patreon.com/>`_ is a membership platform that makes it easy for artists and creators to get paid. Within the Patreon dictionary, subscribers are called "patrons".

Here's a summary of the available Premium tiers and the corresponding unlocked perks, the pricing details will be on the Patreon page.

.. note::
    As an alternative way of gaining access to Premium-locked features, if you are a representative of a "large" Discord server (for reference, servers with at least ~1,500 members and an active userbase), you can apply for a **partnership**: getting access to the cool features and the developer involvement in steering the bot development towards your needs in exchange for advertisement of the bot and the its Patreon on your server.

More perks will be added over time, including free currency and early access to new features!

.. warning::
    You should be the **owner**, or an **administrator** (or a representative of similar rank), of the server you're activating the Patreon perks for. Upon successfully pledging for a Patreon tier, please send a DM to cycloptux#1543 or NaviKing#3820 to get your perks activated.
