Premium Perks

.. note::
    Most, or all, Premium features are enabled by default in AyleeBot-based Discord bots. This page is kept as a reference.

Throughout this documentation, you'll find a few notes about Premium-locked features. These features are only unlocked by either becoming a Patron for the developer, or by establishing a partnership with the developer.

Here's a link to our Patreon page: https://www.patreon.com/cycloptux

As a way to cover the hosting (and development) costs of the bot and its infrastructure, Patreon is used as the main source of month-to-month income.

.. seealso::
    `Patreon <https://www.patreon.com/>`_ is a membership platform that makes it easy for artists and creators to get paid. Within the Patreon dictionary, subscribers are called "patrons".

Here's a summary of the available Premium tiers and the corresponding unlocked perks, the pricing details will be on the Patreon page.

.. note::
    As an alternative way of gaining access to Premium-locked features, if you are a representative of a "large" Discord server, you can apply for a **partnership**: getting access to the cool features and the developer involvement in steering the bot development towards your needs in exchange for advertisement of the bot and the its Patreon on your server.
    For reference, "large" refers to servers with at least ~1,000 members and an active userbase, but you can still apply if you don't meet those requirements: we'll review the specific potential of your server on an individual base.

More perks will be added over time, including free currency and early access to new features!

.. warning::
    You should be the **owner**, or an **administrator** (or a representative of similar rank), of the server you're activating the Patreon perks for. Upon successfully pledging for a Patreon tier, please **submit an entry in the "Patreon Verification" form by sending a DM to GiselleBot#8602 on Discord to request the activation of the premium perks in your server**.
