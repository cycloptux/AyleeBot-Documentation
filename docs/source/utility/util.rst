This module contains generally useful, atomic commands that aren't otherwise categorized into a dedicated module.

These commands might be safe for use by anyone, or locked behind in-Discord permissions.

.. _nsfwjs:

NSFW Images Detection Tools
===========================

|bot_name| implements an (experimental) **NSFW images detection system** using **TensorFlow.js** as its base.

The detection system is based on `Infinite Red's NSFW JS library <https://nsfwjs.com/>`_ and `GantMan's Inception v3 Keras Model for NSFW detection <https://github.com/gantman/nsfw_model/>`_ to classify any image as a composition of **5** categories:

* **Drawings**: Safe for work drawings (including anime).
* **Hentai**: Hentai and pornographic drawings.
* **Neutral**: Safe for work neutral images.
* **Porn**: Pornographic images, sexual acts.
* **Sexy**: Sexually explicit images, not pornography.

The module was furtherly converted into a back-end module and customized with a caching system to enhance its performance.

.. seealso::
    `This interesting article by Infinite Red <https://nsfwjs.com/>`_ explains the reasons behind the creation of the original NSFW JS client-side module.

.. warning::
    This module, by no means, is supposed to reliably recognize all NSFW images. Its main purpose is quickly classifying provided images and supporting humans in better moderating a server.
    
    The module itself will not store or expose any sexually explicit images. The output will not contain a direct link to the original image, and a censored (low resolution, blurred) version of the image will be locally cached and used to refer to the original image.
    
Here's an example of an output of this command, and the corresponding censored image:

.. image:: ../images/util_image_00.png
    :width: 600
    :align: center
    :alt: NSFW Images Detection Output Example
    
.. image:: ../images/util_image_01.jpg
    :align: center
    :alt: NSFW Images Detection Censored Image Example    
    
.. seealso::
    For those of you with a background in image processing - yes, **Lenna** is actually flagged as **NSFW with a confidence score of 81.9%!**
    
    If you don't know what I'm talking about, refer to `this Wikipedia page <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenna>`_.

|bot_prefix|\ nsfwcheck
-----------------------

Command Syntax
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. parsed-literal::

    |bot_prefix|\ nsfwcheck (image URL, or image as a message attachment)
    
Command Description
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Submits an image against the `GantMan's Inception v3 Keras Model for NSFW detection <https://github.com/gantman/nsfw_model/>`_ (as explained above) and returns a detailed output about the classification.

Examples
^^^^^^^^
.. parsed-literal::

    |bot_prefix|\ nsfwcheck http://www.lenna.org/lena_std.tif
    
....

|bot_prefix|\ nsfwcache
-----------------------

Command Syntax
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. parsed-literal::

    |bot_prefix|\ nsfwcache (cache ID)
    
Command Description
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Recalls an image classification output by its cache ID (as given in the footer of the |bot_prefix|\ nsfwcheck command.

Examples
^^^^^^^^
.. parsed-literal::

    |bot_prefix|\ nsfwcache 5d6c4cd78e422b00137d14ce
    
....

.. _nsfwthreshold:

|bot_prefix|\ nsfwthreshold
---------------------------

Command Syntax
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. parsed-literal::

    |bot_prefix|\ nsfwthreshold [new threshold, or "-"]
    
Command Description
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

While the classification scores given to an image cannot be tuned, each server can choose its own NSFW threshold (the sum of NSFW-related scores over which an image is considered NSFW).

The new threshold is an integer within the range ``[0, 100]``, inclusive of ``0`` (treat **all** images as NSFW) and ``100`` (only treat an image as NSFW if the model recognize it as having no-SFW components - which is highly unlikely, hence basically meaning "treat **no** images as NSFW").

Running the command with ``-`` as argument will reset the server threshold to the global, default threshold of **60%**.

Running the command with no arguments will show the current value for the server.

Examples
^^^^^^^^
.. parsed-literal::

    |bot_prefix|\ nsfwthreshold 80
    |bot_prefix|\ nsfwthreshold -
    |bot_prefix|\ nsfwthreshold
    
Permissions Needed
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
| **User**: Manage Server

Server-related Tools
====================

|bot_prefix|\ serverinfo
------------------------

Command Syntax
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. parsed-literal::

    |bot_prefix|\ sinfo

Command Description
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Prints a bunch of info about the current server.

....

|bot_prefix|\ serverbots
------------------------

Command Syntax
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. parsed-literal::

    |bot_prefix|\ sbot [--detail]

Command Description
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Prints the full list of bots that are present in the server.

If the ``--detail`` additional parameter is used, the command will attempt scanning the top 3 most used bot listing websites to get info about the bot owner, and post a link to the found page.

The command will scan:

 * **Top.gg / Discord Bot List**: https://top.gg/
 * **Bots on Discord**: https://bots.ondiscord.xyz/
 * **Discord Bots**: https://discord.bots.gg/
 
This additional scan is usually very slow (about ~5 seconds per bot).

....

|bot_prefix|\ serveremojis
--------------------------

Command Syntax
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. parsed-literal::

    |bot_prefix|\ semoji

Command Description
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Shows all of the emojis from the current server into an embed.

....

|bot_prefix|\ searchuser
------------------------

.. warning::
    This command is **temporarily** disabled due to changes in the Discord API that broke some of the shown parameters. It will be fixed soon.

Command Syntax
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. parsed-literal::

    |bot_prefix|\ searchuser (user id/mention/name, or a substring of the user's name or discriminator)

Command Description
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Searches for a user and returns the known info about that user.

You can use the exact username, or look for users by using a substring of their name (this will only scan the bot cache).

.. note::
    Generally speaking, the bot will look into its cache to find the Discord user(s). If you want to look for uncached users, you **must** use their ID.

Examples
^^^^^^^^
.. parsed-literal::

    |bot_prefix|\ searchuser cyclopt
    |bot_prefix|\ searchuser 1543
    |bot_prefix|\ searchuser cycloptux#1543
    |bot_prefix|\ searchuser 123456789098765432
    
....

Message-related Tools
=====================

.. _publish:

|bot_prefix|\ publish
---------------------

Command Syntax
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. parsed-literal::

    |bot_prefix|\ publish [message id(s)] [--channel {channel id/mention/q_name}]

Command Description
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This command will publish one or more messages sent into an **Announcement Channel**. For more info about Announcement Channels and the publish feature, you can check `this link <https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360032008192-Announcement-Channels->`_ from Discord.

By default, the command will look for messages in the current channel. You can, however, specify a different channel using the ``--channel`` tag. Please make sure that the target channel is an Announcement Channel, otherwise |bot_name| will throw an error.

If the message ID(s) are omitted, |bot_name| will attempt to publish the most recent message (above the command itself).

You can also specify one or more ID(s) to publish specific messages from the target channel.

.. note::
    This specific command is particularly useful for **mobile users**, until Discord adds the ability for the mobile client to publish messages through the UI.

Permissions Needed
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
While technically available to everyone, this command will check for the correct permissions for a user to be able to post/publish a message, according to Discord limitations:

* **Send Messages Permission** will let you publish your own messages in the Announcement Channel
* **Manage Messages Permission** will let you publish all messages in the Announcement Channel

This also applies to |bot_name|\ : Manage Messages Permissions will be required to publish messages coming from other users, but Send Messages Permissions will be enough to make |bot_name| publish its own messages (e.g. messages sent through the :ref:`msgsend` command).

Examples
^^^^^^^^
.. parsed-literal::

    |bot_prefix|\ publish
    |bot_prefix|\ publish 123456789098765432 234567890987654321
    |bot_prefix|\ publish 123456789098765432 --channel #announcements

....

|bot_prefix|\ autopublishsetup
------------------------------

Command Syntax
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. parsed-literal::

    |bot_prefix|\ autopublishsetup [--channel {channel id/mention/q_name}]

Command Description
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This command will open an interactive menu to configure the auto-publish feature on a target channel, provided the channel is set as an **Announcement Channel**. For more info about Announcement Channels and the publish feature, you can check `this link <https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360032008192-Announcement-Channels->`_ from Discord.

You can manually publish messages through |bot_name| using the :ref:`publish` command. Through the use of the auto-publish feature, however, you can set certain Announcement Channels to have all messages (or a subset of messages) automatically published upon being sent.

Options 1. and 2. are used to save the settings you applied through the menu (the settings will not apply until you save them), or discard said changes.

3. "Publish all messages" will automatically publish all messages sent into the target channel. When this setting is enabled, enabling or disabling any of the subsequent settings will not have any effect.
4. "Publish all user messages" will automatically publish all messages coming from real users, ignoring bot messages and webhook/integration messages.
5. "Publish all bot messages" will automatically publish all messages coming from bots, but ignore webhook/integration messages.
6. "Publish all webhook messages" will automatically publish all messages coming from webhooks or external integrations.
7. "Publish if the user/bot has at least one of these roles" will automatically publish messages coming from bots or users having certain roles, and ignore webhook/integration messages or messages coming from bots/users not having any of those roles.

.. note::
    You can configure options 4, 5, 6 and 7 in any mixed set to achieve the desired behavior. Please note that options 4 and 5 will override the role requirements configured through option 7 on the corresponding entity.

If the **Messages** log is enabled in a server channel, each automatically published message will generate an entry into that log. Even publishing errors (e.g. due to rate limits) are logged.

Please refer to the :ref:`log-command` section in the **Administration** module documentation.

Permissions Needed
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
| **User**: Manage Server

**Manage Server Permissions** are required to open the configuration menu.

For the "publishing" permissions themselvers, this command will check for the correct permissions for a user to be able to post/publish a message, according to Discord limitations:

* **Send Messages Permission** will let you publish your own messages in the Announcement Channel
* **Manage Messages Permission** will let you publish all messages in the Announcement Channel

This also applies to |bot_name|\ : Manage Messages Permissions will be required to publish messages coming from other users, but Send Messages Permissions will be enough to make |bot_name| publish its own messages (e.g. messages sent through the :ref:`msgsend` command).

Examples
^^^^^^^^
.. parsed-literal::

    |bot_prefix|\ autopublishsetup
    |bot_prefix|\ autopublishsetup #announcements

....

|bot_prefix|\ rawmessage
------------------------

Command Syntax
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. parsed-literal::

    |bot_prefix|\ rawmsg (message id) [--channel {channel id/mention}]

Command Description
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Shows a specific message content in its "raw" version, making markdown-formatted messages or embeds easy to copy and paste.

Embeds can be re-sent through |bot_name| using the :ref:`msgsend` command. This might not work 100% of the times for complex embeds.

Examples
^^^^^^^^
.. parsed-literal::

    |bot_prefix|\ rawmsg 123456789098765432
    |bot_prefix|\ rawmsg 123456789098765432 --channel #rules
    
....

|bot_prefix|\ savechat
----------------------

Command Syntax
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. parsed-literal::

    |bot_prefix|\ savechat [# of messages]

Command Description
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Dumps a certain number of messages from the channel in which the command is run. The saved messages are compiled into a ``.csv`` file.

The file will be sent to the author of the command via Direct Message. Instead of receiving the actual file as Discord attachment, the author will receive:

* An URL to an **encrypted** ``.zip`` file containing the actual ``.csv``.
* The password to decrypt the archive.

.. note::
    The archive password is unknown to anyone but the author of the command, not even the bot developer!
    The archive will only be available for 30 days, after which it will be deleted.

If the number of messages isn't specified, the default value of **150** messages will be used.

.. warning::
    This command might be very slow, or even fail, if you are trying to dump a high amount of messages. Please be patient.

Permissions Needed
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
| **User**: Manage Messages

Examples
^^^^^^^^
.. parsed-literal::

    |bot_prefix|\ savechat 500

....

|bot_prefix|\ emojify
---------------------

Command Syntax
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. parsed-literal::

    |bot_prefix|\ emojify (any number of emoji names, without the : :)

Command Description
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Converts a sequence of words into a sequence of emojis, provided the bot has access to the emojis.

Emoji names are case-sensitive.

By default, this command only tries to fetch emojis from the current server, effectively limitating its usefulness.

By setting one, or more, server(s) as emojify source servers using the |bot_prefix|\ emojifysource command, |bot_name| will look for emojis in those servers as well as the current server when the |bot_prefix|\ emojify command is used.

Examples
^^^^^^^^
.. parsed-literal::

    |bot_prefix|\ emojify BlobOwO BlobPats
    
....

|bot_prefix|\ emojifyverbose
----------------------------

Command Syntax
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. parsed-literal::

    |bot_prefix|\ emojifyverbose (emoji name, without the : :)

Command Description
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Converts one word into the corresponding emoji, provided the bot has access to that emoji. The response will also include info about the server where the emoji was fetched from.

Emoji names are case-sensitive.

By default, this command only tries to fetch emojis from the current server, effectively limitating its usefulness.

By setting one, or more, server(s) as emojify source servers using the |bot_prefix|\ emojifysource command, |bot_name| will look for emojis in those servers as well as the current server when the |bot_prefix|\ emojify command is used.

Examples
^^^^^^^^
.. parsed-literal::

    |bot_prefix|\ emojifyverbose BlobOwO

....

|bot_prefix|\ emojifysource
---------------------------

Command Syntax
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. parsed-literal::

    |bot_prefix|\ emojifysource [server id(s)]

Command Description
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

By default, the |bot_prefix|\ emojify command only tries to fetch emojis from the current server, effectively limitating its usefulness.

By setting one, or more, server(s) as emojify source servers, |bot_name| will look for emojis in those servers as well as the current server when the |bot_prefix|\ emojify command is used.

.. note::
    |bot_name| must be in the emojify source server for it to correctly fetch emojis. You can, although, preemptively authorize a server before |bot_name| has been invited in it.
    
If used without any server ID, this command will show the current list of servers that are set as emojify source.

If used with one or more server IDs, it will toggle each server into the list of servers that will be used as emojify source servers.

When a server is set as unavailable through the |bot_prefix|\ emojifyexclude command, it will appear with a ``:no_entry:`` sign.

Permissions Needed
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
| **User**: Manage Emojis

Examples
^^^^^^^^
.. parsed-literal::

    |bot_prefix|\ emojifysource
    |bot_prefix|\ emojifysource 123456789098765432 234567890987654321 345678909876543212

....

|bot_prefix|\ emojifyexclude
----------------------------

Command Syntax
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. parsed-literal::

    |bot_prefix|\ emojifyexclude

Command Description
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Makes the emojis contained in the server where the command is run unavailable to the |bot_prefix|\ emojify command.

Run the command again to toggle the exclusion status of the server.

When a server is set as unavailable, it will appear with a ``:no_entry:`` sign through the |bot_prefix|\ emojifysource command.

Permissions Needed
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
| **User**: Manage Server

....

|bot_prefix|\ embed
-------------------

Command Syntax
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. parsed-literal::

    |bot_prefix|\ embed (text build with Nadeko's embed builder, or using embed enhancer tags)

Command Description
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Answers to the author's message with an embedded message.

In order to customize your embed, you can either use:

* `NadekoBot's Embed Builder <https://eb.nadeko.bot/>`_
* The available embed enhancer tags

Embed enhancer tags are words in the form ``{tag}`` that are used to set a few fields of an embed. Currently, these tags are supported:

* ``{title}`` sets the title for the embed.
* ``{url}`` sets an URL for the embed, which means clicking on the title will bring users to the specified URL.
* ``{footer}`` sets the footer for the embed (the small text at the bottom of the embed).
* ``{color}`` sets the color for the embed. You need to use an hex code to select a color.
* ``{image}`` and ``{thumbnail}`` will set the bottom image and top-right thumbnail within the embed.

.. seealso::
    Do you need ideas for your embed color? Try these links:
    `Random Hex Color Code Generator <https://www.random.org/colors/hex>`_
    `HTML Color Picker <https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_picker.asp>`_
    `BrandColors <https://brandcolors.net/>`_

.. note::
    A few things to know when building your embed with the enhancer tags:

    * Tags have to start on a new line, surrounded by ``{ }`` parenthesis.
    * URLs have to be complete and correct, including the http*:// prefix.
    * Supported image formats are \*.png, \*.jpg, \*.jpeg.
    * If you need to add something that looks like an enhancer tag in your recruitment message, you can "escape" by prepending it with ``\``
    
.. warning:: 
    `Discord's native limits <https://discordapp.com/developers/docs/resources/channel#embed-limits>`_ for embeds still apply.

Examples
^^^^^^^^
.. parsed-literal::
    
    |bot_prefix|\ embed { "description": "Hello world!" }
    |bot_prefix|\ embed {title} Hey I'm recruiting! This is my title, it can hold up to 256 characters!
        {color} #ffffff
        {footer} This is your fancy footer text.

.. _deletedm:

|bot_prefix|\ deletedm
----------------------

Command Syntax
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. parsed-literal::

    |bot_prefix|\ deletedm (message id)
    
Command Description
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. note::
    This command is only available in a Direct Message channel with the bot. It will **not** work in actual servers, and it's not subject to any permissions.

Deletes a direct message sent by the bot. This can be particularly useful as a privacy/security feature to delete previously sent passwords to encrypted archives, in order to make them completely unrecoverable.

.. seealso::
    Refer to :ref:`discord-ids` if you don't know how to obtain a message ID.

.. note::
    Non-sensitive direct messages (e.g. moderation actions) might still be logged into the owner-restricted bot console.

Examples
^^^^^^^^
.. parsed-literal::

    |bot_prefix|\ deletedm 123456789098765432

--------------------

Command Syntax
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. parsed-literal::

    |bot_prefix|\ rid (role name, or a substring of the role name)

Command Description
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

While offering easy ways of obtaining the IDs of a certain number of entities, Discord doesn't offer an easy way to get the ID of a role, which is often needed for bot commands (see :ref:`discord-ids`).

This commands shows a list of roles and the corresponding IDs found, starting from the name (or substring thereof) of the role. The lookup string is case-insensitive.

Command Syntax
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. parsed-literal::

    |bot_prefix|\ shorturl (long URL)

Command Description
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Converts a long URL into a short URL using the proprietary **gisl.eu** shortening service.

.. note::
    URLs shortened using the gisl.eu service never expire, unless deleted by the person that created the short URL (feature not available yet).
    The original URLs are saved as encrypted strings within the redirection database. Any sensitive data contained in the URL (authentication keys, login info, etc.) will not be exposed in case of a breach.

Examples
^^^^^^^^
.. parsed-literal::

    |bot_prefix|\ shorturl http://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Wireless-Reading-Display-Globally/dp/B003FSUDM4/ref=amb_link_353259562_2?pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_s=center-10&pf_rd_r=11EYKTN682A79T370AM3&pf_rd_t=201&pf_rd_p=1270985982&pf_rd_i=B002Y27P3M

The value and originating unit are mandatory. If the destination unit is omitted or invalid (e.g. non-existing, or a unit in a different measure, like trying to convert length to mass) then the "best" destination unit will be picked. For currencies, if the destination currency is omitted or invalid, ``USD`` will be automatically used.

.. _clockchannel:

|bot_prefix|\ clockchannel
--------------------------

Command Syntax
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. parsed-literal::

    |bot_prefix|\ clockchannel (time zone name) [--template {custom channel name template}] [--12ht]

Command Description
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Creates a channel as "clock channel", updating its name every 10 minutes. You must specify the time zone name: if you need to search for a valid time zone name, use the :ref:`searchtz` command.

.. note::
    The initial implementation of this command used to have clocks update every minute. Discord suddenly changed the rate limit of channel updates to **2 updates every 10 minutes**, but the rate limiter is not precise. The 10-minutes update is the safest update that is still useful to track time.

You can set a custom template for the channel name. You can use one (or more) of these placeholders in your custom channel name template:

* **%time\_zone%** or **%tz%**: This will be replaced with the name of the chosen time zone.
* **%clock%**: This will be replaced with the auto-updating clock.
* **%date%**: This will be replaced with the current date.

Additionally, you can add the ``--12ht`` parameter if you want the clock to be shown as 12 hours time.

By default, the channel name template is ``%time_zone%: %clock%``.

.. admonition:: Premium

    Out of the box, each server is limited to having **5 clock channels**. You can unlock up to **10 different clock channels** as a **Premium** feature (see: :ref:`premium-perks`). This Premium limit was increased from 1/5 after the Discord rate limit update.
