Trivia

.. warning::
    This module is currently on a **Closed Beta Test (CBT)** phase. The module design is reaching its stable phase and isn't currently final. This documentation page will be updated as the module reaches its Release Candidate (RC) phase.
    
This module lets users play trivia quiz games on Discord. The module gets its default questions from the **Open Trivia Database**, which offers more than 3,000 validated questions in more than 15 categories.

The trivia module is meant to be public and used by anyone for fun. Users with "Manage Messages" & "Manage Roles" permissions, hereafter called "Elevated Users", will also have access to extra settings that will make them able to set trivia quiz games up for use by other users (typical use cases include events, giveaways, etc.).

Trivia games can be **timed** or **immediate**.

* **Immediate** trivia games move to the next question as soon as one answer is collected.
* **Timed** trivia games move to the next question as soon as a certain time interval passes, and collect answers from anyone during that period (limitations may apply, see later).

Depending on the "type" of user running the command(s), some limitations apply to the usage of the trivia module. The following table shows such limitations.

+-------------------------+----+-----------+-------+---------+-----+-----+
| User Type               | MQ | MT        | RR    | TC      | AD  | CT  |
+=========================+====+===========+=======+=========+=====+=====+
| Normal (non-"Elevated") | 10 | 3 minutes | No    | No      | No  | No  |
+-------------------------+----+-----------+-------+---------+-----+-----+
| Elevated                | 20 | 6 hours   | Yes\* | Yes\*\* | Yes | Yes |
+-------------------------+----+-----------+-------+---------+-----+-----+
| Elevated (Premium)      | 30 | 7 days    | Yes\* | Yes\*\* | Yes | Yes |
+-------------------------+----+-----------+-------+---------+-----+-----+

* **MQ**: Maximum # of Questions
* **MT**: Maximum Time Interval
* **RR**: Can set role restrictions
* **TC**: Can set a different target channel
* **AD**: Can configure auto-deletion of messages
* **CT**: Can configure someone else's trivia

| :sub:`\*: Users are not allowed to set a role restriction to roles higher than the highest role they have.`
| :sub:`\*\*: Users are not allowed to set a target channel to a channel they don't have R/W access to (Read Messages and/or Send Messages).`

.. admonition:: Premium

    As shown in the table, premium-enabled servers will have an increased cap of 30 questions and can set an interval for timed trivia games up to 1 week.

-------------------------

Command Syntax
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. parsed-literal::

    |bot_prefix|\ trsetup (trivia id)
    
Command Description
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Opens the trivia game interactive setup menu. Use the menu items to configure the above settings.

**Name** will show in the title of each embed related to that trivia. Trivia names cannot be longer than 128 characters.

**Description** will appear on each question, and in the starting and final embed. Trivia descriptions cannot be longer than 1024 characters.

**Categories** can be left blank ("any category") or it can be used to restrict the questions to **one or more** categories. At the time of writing this documentation page, the categories available from the Open Trivia Database are:

1. Animals
2. Art
3. Celebrities
#. Entertainment: Board Games
#. Entertainment: Books
#. Entertainment: Cartoon & Animations
#. Entertainment: Comics
#. Entertainment: Film
#. Entertainment: Japanese Anime & Manga

#. Vehicles

The categories selection supports partial names: if you want to select "Mythology" you can just use "myth", etc.

.. note::
    There will soon be a way to add custom categories and custom questions to the database.

**Interval** is the amount of time a question will be up in a **timed** trivia. Disabling this parameter sets the trivia mode to **immediate**. Go to the top of this page to understand the difference between the two modes.

**Questions Amount** is the number of questions after which the trivia game will end. Refer to the limitations table at the top of this page to know the limits. A trivia game will always end if the actual amount of available questions is lower than the "configured" amount.

**Channel** is the actual channel the trivia will be started into after the |bot_prefix|\ triviastart command. As stated in the limitations table, it can be set to another channel only if you are an "Elevated" user.

.. note::
    There can only be **1** running (or paused) trivia game per channel at a given time.
    
**Authorized Roles**, as the name suggests, are roles authorized to submit answers to the selected trivia. If omitted, everyone will be able to submit an answer. If one or more roles are configured, users will need to have at least one of these roles to submit an answer.

**Auto-deletion of Answers** toggles whether or not the bot should delete the answers posted by a user. In order to keep the secrecy of a user's answer (especially in timed trivia games), this configuration is active by default.

**Auto-deletion of Confirmation Messages** toggles whether or not the bot should delete its own confirmation message upon registering an answer. The deletion of confirmation messages happens after 5 seconds.
