Technical & Security Background
*******************************

Other than being a developer, I work as an IT Security Analyst for a big IT company (10K+ employees) in the Telecom & Media industry. This security background also drove a lot of choices during the bot development and deployment, which will be listed and described in this page.

....

Core Engine
===========

InugamiBot is a private bot based on the public GiselleBot.

The bot is written in Node.js, and uses `Discord.js v12 <https://discord.js.org/>`_ as core Discord library.

At the time of writing this page (June 21st, 2019), here are some dates and numbers about the bot:

* ~38,000 code lines, excluding JSON files.
* 48 technical dependencies, including performance enhancement libraries and self-coded libraries.
* Present in 125 Discord servers, covering over 50,000 users.
* Development started in October, 2017, making Giselle (the main bot) 1 year and a half old.
* Giselle turned from being a private bot into a public bot in March, 2018.
* Since her launch, Giselle has handled over 27,000 successful commands, with an average of 45 successful commands per day.
* Since her public launch, there hasn't been any major downtime in her online status, except for 2-3 days of downtime due to a Discord outage during summer, 2018.

....

Infrastructure
==============

The bot is hosted in a cloud infrastructure. The infrastructure is currently composed of 3 main components:

* 1 Web Server, hosting her dashboard (work-in-progress), documentation website and the API gateway used to communicate with the bots from the dashboard.
* 1 Application Server, hosting the bot itself.
* 3 MongoDB machines, forming a Replica Set.

Other than the plain computing power, the cloud infrastructure offers a few other managed services used by the bot:

* Object Storage buckets, hosting the temporary (encrypted) files that are sent to end-users upon using a bunch of commands.
* A DNS managed service, hosting both the public cycloptux.com domain and the internal private domain.
* A Key Management System, storing the secret keys and API keys used by the bot. Private keys and/or credentials are never stored on the actual servers, they are fetched during the startup of each service.
* An IAM service, enabling the virtual servers to communicate with the cloud services without having to store credentials within the system itself.
* An automatic build & deployment pipeline service, updating the documentation website as soon as a change is pushed to the `GitHub documentation repository <https://github.com/cycloptux/GiselleBot>`_.

....

Security
========

Regarding the security aspects of the bot, here's a list of features that have been implemented:

Encryption in Transit
---------------------
* Internal network communications between the web server, application server, and db server(s) only happen on a private network within the cloud infrastructure and never go through the internet.
* Network connections between the application server, web server and DB machines are encrypted using SSL/TLS (specifically, TLS 1.1+) encryption, with 2-way forced validation of server and client certificates.
* Network connections between the API gateway and the application server are encrypted using HTTPS (TLS 1.2+) encryption, with forced 2-way validation of server and client certificates.
* The certificates used to encrypt data in transit are released by an internal Certificate Authority (which is powered off when not in use, to protect its keys). The certificates are signed by an intermediate CA which then points at the root CA, so that the root CA key is never used and the intermediate CA can be killed if compromised.
* The web server and API gateway are only exposed to the internet through HTTPS (HSTS). The web access itself is also protected through `Cloudflare <https://www.cloudflare.com/>`_. The network connection between Cloudflare and the actual web server is also protected by strict HTTPS.

Encryption at Rest
------------------
* All storage media (hard disks, object storage repositories, etc.) are protected through low-level encryption.
* Sensitive and personal data stored in the database are encrypted with AES-128-GCM algorithm.
* Commands that generate big files (such as a chat log) might transmit the file to the user via Direct Message by temporarily storing it into an encrypted Object Storage bucket. The archive itself is also encrypted using 7-Zip's encryption algorithm, based on AES-256.
  
  * The password is purposefully never logged into the bot internal logs and is only known to the end user.
  * As an extra layer of security, users can decide to delete the bot's message so that the password is also removed from Discord itself. Refer to :ref:`deletedm` for more info.
  * The retention for these files is currently set to 30 days. Lowering the retention to 7 or 14 days is under consideration.
 

Authentication, Authorization, Auditing
---------------------------------------
* SSH access is protected via private keys and, in some cases, multi-factor authentication.
* Authorization between the virtual servers and the external cloud services is managed by IAM roles on the infrastructure-level so that credentials don't need to be stored on the servers.
* Every access and action is logged, both in the API gateway and in the application server. All bot commands are logged.
* The API offered by the bots are not directly accessed from the internet. The API gateway acts as a bridge, and implements a fully fledged authentication and authorization workflow used to create and distribute temporary tokens to the end users.

Infrastructure Security
-----------------------
* Each host is protected by an infrastructure firewall **and** a local firewall, making sure that only the required ports are open.
* Cloud infrastructure management portals are protected by strong passwords and multi-factor authentication.
* Encryption keys, secret access keys, secret tokens, credentials, etc. are **never** stored into local drives. An external Key Management System (KMS) is used to fetch secret keys at runtime.
