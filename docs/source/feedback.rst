Feedback Workflows
******************

The Feedback Workflows module enables users to set up Q/A workflows that are presented to those that send a Direct Message to the bot. The Q/As can be set up to be a sequence of multi-choice or open questions, with the final output being sent into a server channel by the bot itself.


|bot_prefix|\ workflowpreview
-----------------------------

Command Syntax
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. parsed-literal::

    |bot_prefix|\ wfp
    
Command Description
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Prints the list of available workflows for the current server. For each workflow, a preview of each question (and the corresponding question ID) is shown.

....

|bot_prefix|\ workflowinit
--------------------------

Command Syntax
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. parsed-literal::

    |bot_prefix|\ wfinit

Command Description
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Initializes a new workflow setup. The bot will guide the user into setting up the basic configurations and first question.
Workflow questions will expire after:

* 2 minutes, for reaction questions;
* 15 minutes, for open questions.

The format to set a workflow question is:

.. parsed-literal::

    (message/reaction)|(text of the question)|(list of reactions)/[validation words]|[alias]|[Trello mapping]
    
Each question has to be set using 4 fields, separated by one ``|`` character.

* First field: ``message`` will require the question to be answered with a plain text message. ``reaction`` will require the user to select one answer by clicking on a reaction that will be added to the question by the bot.
* Second field: The actual question.
* Third field:

  * If ``reaction`` is selected in the first field, this field will list all of the possible answers, using ``;`` to separate these answers. If this is the case, this field is **mandatory**. Please note that, due to Discord limitations, there can only be a maximum of 20 answers. Answers from the 21st onward will be ignored.
  * If ``message`` is selected in the first field, this field will include a list of validation words: any anwer given by the target user will be ignored unless the message contains at least one of the chosen words/sentences (case insensitive). Again, you can separate words/sentences with ``;``. If this is the case, this field is optional.

* Fourth field: The question "alias". This is the title that will replace the full question when the feedback is posted in the server channel. This field is optional, but it's higly suggested that you set an alias.
* Fifth field: This will map the question into one of the entities of the Trello board:

  * ``title`` will use the answer as the title of a card. 
  * ``list`` will use the answer as the title of a list.
  * ``label`` will add the answer as a card label. 
  * ``attachment`` will add the answer as a card attachment.
  * ``description`` will add the answer as part of the description text, with the format: ``{Alias}: {Text}``.

Please note that a field being "optional" means that its content can be left blank, but the field itself has to exist; e.g. ``message|Heads or Tails?||The user picked...|``
