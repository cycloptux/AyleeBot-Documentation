Generates a random minesweeper board. Any user can play locally by unhiding the spoiler tags on the board. No other kind of interaction is implemented, just have fun and play fair!

Use one of the optional tags to create a new board of the selected difficulty. "Normal" is the default mode, if the difficulty tag is omitted.
