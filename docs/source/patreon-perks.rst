.. note::
    Most, or all, Patreon features are enabled by default in AyleeBot-based Discord bots. This page is kept as a reference.

Throughout this documentation, you'll find a few notes about Patreon-locked features. Here's a link to the Patreon page of the developer: https://www.patreon.com/cycloptux

As a way to cover the hosting (and development) costs of the bot and its infrastructure, Patreon is used as the main source of month-to-month income.

.. seealso::
    `Patreon <https://www.patreon.com/>`_ is a membership platform that makes it easy for artists and creators to get paid. Within the Patreon dictionary, subscribers are called "patrons".

Within the various module pages you'll find details about the perks that are unlocked by being a patron. Here's a summary of the available Patreon tiers and the corresponding unlocked perks, the pricing details will be on the Patreon page.

More perks will be added over time, including free currency and early access to new features!

.. warning::
    You need to be the **owner**, or an **administrator** (or a representative of similar rank), of the server you're activating the Patreon perks for. Upon successfully pledging for a Patreon tier, please send a DM to cycloptux#1543 or NaviKing#3820 to get your perks activated.
